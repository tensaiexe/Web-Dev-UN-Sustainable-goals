        <h2>No Poverty</h2>
        <p>Poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high vulnerability of certain populations to disasters,
             diseases and other phenomena which prevent them from being productive.
            There are many reasons, but in short, because as human beings, our well- being is linked to each other. 
            Growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increas- ing political and social tensions and, 
            in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts.</p>

        <h2>Good Health and Well-being</h2>
        <p>A significant portion of the global population still lacks access to vital healthcare services.
             To bridge this gap and ensure equitable healthcare provision, addressing disparities is critical. 
             Various determinants of health, including environmental and commercial factors, need attention to
             pave the way for achieving our common objective of Health for All and achieving the Sustainable
             Development Goal targets.</p>

        <h2>Quality Education</h2>
        <p>While progress has been made towards the 2030 education targets set by the United Nations,
             continued efforts are required to address persistent challenges and ensure that quality 
             education is accessible to all, leaving no one behind.
            Between 2015 and 2021, there was an increase in worldwide primary school completion, lower 
            secondary completion, and upper secondary completion. Nevertheless, the progress made during 
            this period was notably slower compared to the 15 years prior</p>
